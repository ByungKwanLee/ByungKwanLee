## Byung-Kwan Lee's Github

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently NVIDIA Research Scientist Intern, and my job is researching innovative technologies leading to Publish Top-Tier Conferences, Tech Transfer to Product, and Contributing the world. 

ðŸŽ“ I am Ph.D in KAIST EE, and my topic is to build high-performing, efficient-size vision language models by using merging proper modules, modifying architectures, and distilling cross-model or self-model knowledge, thereby surpassing GPT-4V!

ðŸ¥… It is my dream to build real AGI model with my own hands.

🔭 I’m currently Research Scientist at NVIDIA, building high-performing, efficient-size vision language models by merging proper modules, modifying architectures, and distilling cross-model or self-model knowledge, thereby surpassing really larger open- or closed-source models!

🥅 It is my dream to build real AGI model with my own hands, contribuitng the world's advancement.
